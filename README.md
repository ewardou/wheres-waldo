This project was inspired by the Where's Waldo game, but instead of looking for Waldo, the player is looking for diverse videogame characters. I used firebase in this application to store information about characters' location in the map and the score of previous users, aswell as image assets.

The menu at the start lets you choose a level. When one of the cards is clicked a request is made to the database to fetch the information and images needed.

When the user clicks the map during the game, a target and a list of characters are displayed around the area clicked, from where the user can pick which one it thinks is occupying that area.
